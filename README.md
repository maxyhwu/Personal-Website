# Max's Personal Website ReadMe

Welcome!  
This is Max's personal website.  

---
On this page, you could take a quick, first look about me: my habits, experiences, projects, and so on. I just try to record my life and works on my way of trying to become a well-prepared software engineer.  Also, I might put some thoughts and daily notes on the site later. For more information about me, feel free to [contact me](mailto:b09705045@ntu.im).
